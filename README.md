# Learn dot product or inner product math
This is a quick program to practice the math behind dot and inner products with
a simple user interface. Simply run:

      `python learn_inner.py`

## Inner Product
If you take the inner product, C, of two m,n matrices A and B, then:

$$ C[i,j] = A[i,:]*B[j,:] $$


## Dot Product
Likewise, if you take the dot product, C, of two m,n matrices A and B, then:

$$ C[i,j] = A[i,:]*B[:,j] $$
